# Characterizing Network Behavior in Phishing Emails

**Abstract**

Phishing attacks are one of the most common and damaging threats to cybersecurity, and
consist of targeting an individual with an email to lure them into revealing personal information.
Past studies focused on identifying phishing attacks based on the contents of emails. The
nature of phishing attacks have evolved in complexity, as both attackers and those trying to
defend from attacks have increasingly sophisticated methods. This project aims to identify
network-level characteristics of phishing attacks, an area that we hypothesize will be harder for
attackers to evolve their characteristics and may be more robust for detection. Through analysis
of email headers, we are able to characterize where phishing attacks are coming from and
temporal patterns of phishing behavior.  With our understanding of these behaviors, we hope to
further the understanding of phishing behavior and implement a feature-based detection system
that will improve current efforts.
